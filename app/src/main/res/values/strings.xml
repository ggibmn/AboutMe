    <string name="bio">"I like learning new skills and recently I have been interested in exploring different languages as they help me explore new cultures around the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started learning Spanish online and I have already cleared the beginner level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        I generally spend my weekends focusing on exploring new Spanish words and watching Spanish movies to strengthen my grasp over the language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        I have a pet dog named Cookie and spending time with him is one of my favourite things to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        I also love to travel and I often plan trips with my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        But solo travelling gives me the bliss that I crave for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        Every year I look forward to exploring new places and catching up on some lifetime memories.&lt;br /&gt;
        I love playing football in my free time as it helps me unwind, relax as well as boosts my creativity and analytical thinking skills.\n\n"
