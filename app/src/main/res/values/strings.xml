    <string name="bio">I like learning new skills and recently I have been interested in exploring different languages as they help me explore new cultures around the world.
        \nI started learning Spanish online and I have already cleared the beginner level.
        \nI generally spend my weekends focusing on exploring new Spanish words and watching Spanish movies to strengthen my grasp over the language.
        \nI have a pet dog named Cookie and spending time with him is one of my favourite things to do.
        \nI also love to travel and I often plan trips with my family.
        \nBut solo travelling gives me the bliss that I crave for.
        \nEvery year I look forward to exploring new places and catching up on some lifetime memories.
        \nI love playing football in my free time as it helps me unwind, relax as well as boosts my creativity and analytical thinking skills.
