    <string name="bio">"I like learning new skills and recently I have been interested in exploring different languages as they help me explore new cultures around the world.
        I started learning Spanish online and I have already cleared the beginner level.
        I generally spend my weekends focusing on exploring new Spanish words and watching Spanish movies to strengthen my grasp over the language.
        I have a pet dog named Cookie and spending time with him is one of my favourite things to do.
        I also love to travel and I often plan trips with my family.
        But solo travelling gives me the bliss that I crave for.
        Every year I look forward to exploring new places and catching up on some lifetime memories.
        I love playing football in my free time as it helps me unwind, relax as well as boosts my creativity and analytical thinking skills."
